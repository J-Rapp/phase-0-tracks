#Robot using an elevator#

- After entering the elevator, robot scans the elevator panel for buttons with integer values on them
- For every button with an integer, robot stores the spatial information as a like variable
    - If button is not a valid integer (such as the "door close" button), robot disregards button
- Robot then asks you what floor you would like to go to
    - Until floor number is a stored integer, robot asks what floor again
    - When floor number is a stored integer, robot presses the correlated button
    - Secret string passphrase "Heaven", robot overrides elevator controls and shoots you to space
- If there are no buttons and it's some fancy-pants touch screen elevator, robot self-desctructs


#Real life algorithm idea - The Dish Washer#

- Grab dirty dish from the sink
    - If washing instructions state it is not dishwasher safe, gets set to the side
- Prep the dish
    - Turn on hot water
    - Rinse off debris
        - If debris sticks on the dish, grab scrubby sponge
        - Put soap on scrubby sponge
        - Scrub debris spots until removed
        - If time spent scrubbing debris is greater than ten seconds, stop attempt
    - Turn off water
- Once dish is prep, place dish in the dishwasher
    - If larger dish, place near outside perimeter on rack
    - If similar size and shape to another dish, stack in same area and similar manner
    - If top rack only washing instructions, place on top rack
    - If utensil, put in utnesil holder
    - If sharp knife, put on top rack
    - If cup or mug, put on top rack
    - Until all dish surface areas exposed to water jet streams, reposition dishes
- Open detergent holder and insert desired dish detergent
- Close dishwasher and begin cycle
- Finish by hand-washing all non-dishwasher safe dished and air dry
