# I'm coding a program that takes a spy's real name and converts it into an alias
# I am supposed to meet three criteria:
	# 1) The first and last names must be switched
	# 2) Every consonant must index +1
	# 3) Every vowel must index +1

# I need to break the "name" string into an array of individual letters
# Should I ask for First/Last seperately, or figure out a way to break into two arrays at the space?

# Next I need to see if there's methods to differentiate between vowels and consonants
# If there is I can just run that on the array
# Otherwise I need to figureout a flow that serparates the two

# I need each vowel and consonant to index +1, probably just within a block on the .next method

# Last step is some reassembly of the array into a string with the .join method
