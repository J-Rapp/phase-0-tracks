# Release 2 questions (for my own reference/sake)

# 1) How do you delete a key-pair value? 
# hash_name.delete(key)

# 2) What happens if you try to access the value of a key that is not in the hash?
# It returns a value of 'nil'

# 3) Regarding the answer you got for the previous question, is there a way to set a different default return value when a key is not present in the hash?
# hash_name.default = "default_value"

# 4) How can you access just the keys of a hash? What data type does this method return?
# hash_name.keys - gets you an array!

# 5) How do you remove everything from the hash at once (returning an empty hash)?
# hash_name.clear

# 6) How can you access just the values of a hash?
# hash_name.values
