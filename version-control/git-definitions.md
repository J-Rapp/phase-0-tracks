# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
    - Version control sets virtual "save points" as you modify the contents of a repository. This allows you to roll back to previous points in your progress if needed.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
    - A branch is a separate version of the master repository, which starts as identical at first, but is intended for making alterations over time. Branches are useful for testing out various modifications to a master repository without needing to worry about effecting the master in detrimental ways.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
    - A commit is the digital marker for those "save points". A good commit message should be written in present tense, and should give excellent detail as to what changes have occured since the previous commit.
* What is a merge conflict?
    - A merge conflict occurs when Git is unable to reconcile separate pushes applied to any given branch.
