Reflection:

HTML semantic tags allow a programmer to diversify a pages content. Sometimes the tags don't really have distinct meaning when you are viewing them in a browser window, but they carry quite a bit of meaning for styling and accessibility purposes.

Typically browsers display HTML elements of a page in the order they are written.

I learned that Sublime snippets can be a pretty powerful tool for increasing efficiency and reducing errors with coding workflow. I can see myself creating and utilzing more of them.

The snippets were definitely the most complicated concept. I intend to research them more and create/modify some of my own!
