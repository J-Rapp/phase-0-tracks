**PLAN OF (2-hour) ATTAK**
    - it's currently 10:10 AM

0) find some good music mixes to keep me going and in focus

1) google (15 minutes?) 
    - super simple "basic of jquery" or "jquery in 10 minutes" kinda stuff
    - TAKE NOTES BRO

2) check-in (15 minutes?)
    - did I find some stuff?
    - if true, try some of it
    - else, google.

3) implement (80 minutes)
    - come up with a project and a way to try out some jquery stuff
    - exceute said project
    - maybe ya gotta google again, yaknow?

4) recap (10 minutes)
    - So how'd it go? Reflect on both jquery AND timeboxing approach
    - Did the timeboxing work
    - Did you learn anything about jQuery?

Aight, now it's 10:20, music is playing. Let's google some Jquery. See you at 10:30.

1)

- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrFKgleAcA0
- "<script src="js/jquery.js"></script>" goes inside header
- now write JS in HTML page header
- you can run document.ready(stuff) so that you can still have the JS at the top of the page and have it act on elements that load after

___________

2) OK it's 10:30
    - The video was really helpful for explaining some basics, I think I can run a small experiment of animating an HTML object's CSS
    - some things I'll need for implementing
        + an index page with some HTML elements
        + a css stylesheet (so I can manipulate certain values later with jQuery)
        + jQuery code in the same directory
    - I want to spend another couple minutes researching a jQuery cheat sheet or docs, and at the end I'll have my basic idea I want to implement
    - see you at 10:45 AM
    - 10:35 looks like I might need to install Node first before my computer will run jQuery? Might be a snag
    - 10:39 but maybe I can run it from the web?
    - 10:44 ok - found a guide https://learn.jquery.com/about-jquery/how-jquery-works/
    - 10:45 found a cheat sheet https://oscarotero.com/jquery/

3) OK it's 10:46
    - Step 1 lets get basic jquery set up in the directory and see if we can run a html page without an error
